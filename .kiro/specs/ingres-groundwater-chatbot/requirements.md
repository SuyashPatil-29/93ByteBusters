# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The INGRES Groundwater AI Chatbot is a specialized virtual assistant that transforms an existing stock chatbot into an intelligent interface for India's groundwater data and assessment results. The system will serve as a comprehensive tool for accessing INGRES (India Ground Water Resource Estimation System) data, CGWB reports, and real-time groundwater monitoring information, supporting researchers, policymakers, and citizens in making informed decisions about India's groundwater resources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Integration and Access

**User Story:** As a groundwater researcher, I want to access comprehensive INGRES database information and CGWB data through natural language queries, so that I can quickly retrieve specific groundwater assessment data without navigating complex databases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user queries groundwater data THEN the system SHALL fetch information from the INGRES database (https://ingres.iith.ac.in/home)
2. WHEN requesting CGWB data THEN the system SHALL access Central Ground Water Board repositories and annual assessment reports
3. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL provide access to assessment data from 2017-2024 and beyond
4. IF real-time monitoring data is available THEN the system SHALL integrate current groundwater monitoring information
5. WHEN external research is needed THEN the system SHALL use SERP API integration to fetch scientific publications and government reports

### Requirement 2: Intelligent Query Processing

**User Story:** As a policy maker, I want to ask complex questions about groundwater status in natural language, so that I can get comprehensive answers about regional assessments, trends, and categorizations without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks about annual recharge estimates THEN the system SHALL provide data by region/block/mandal/taluk
2. WHEN extraction data is requested THEN the system SHALL calculate and display total extraction volumes and trends
3. WHEN categorization status is queried THEN the system SHALL classify regions as Safe (<70%), Semi-Critical (70-90%), Critical (90-100%), or Over-Exploited (>100%)
4. WHEN geographical queries are made THEN the system SHALL provide state-wise, district-wise, and block-level assessments
5. WHEN technical methodology questions are asked THEN the system SHALL explain GIS-based analysis, calculation parameters, and data collection processes

### Requirement 3: Interactive Visualization Generation

**User Story:** As a government official, I want to see groundwater data presented through interactive charts, maps, and dashboards, so that I can better understand trends and make data-driven decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN groundwater status is requested THEN the system SHALL generate dynamic status maps with regional color coding
2. WHEN trend analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL create time-series charts comparing 2017-2024 data
3. WHEN regional comparisons are requested THEN the system SHALL display interactive comparison dashboards
4. WHEN category distribution is queried THEN the system SHALL generate pie charts showing assessment categories
5. WHEN recharge/extraction data is requested THEN the system SHALL create interactive graphs with drill-down capabilities

### Requirement 4: Multilingual Communication

**User Story:** As a citizen from any Indian state, I want to interact with the chatbot in my preferred language, so that I can access groundwater information without language barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a language THEN the system SHALL support English, Hindi, and 9 regional languages (Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Assamese, Odia)
2. WHEN technical terms are translated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all languages
3. WHEN dynamic responses are generated THEN the system SHALL use translation APIs for real-time multilingual support
4. WHEN regional context is relevant THEN the system SHALL adapt cultural context for different regions

### Requirement 5: Real-time Research Integration

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want access to the latest groundwater studies, policies, and news updates, so that I can stay informed about current developments in groundwater management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN latest research is requested THEN the system SHALL use SERP API to fetch current scientific publications
2. WHEN policy updates are queried THEN the system SHALL retrieve recent government reports and policy changes
3. WHEN news about groundwater is requested THEN the system SHALL provide relevant current news updates
4. WHEN external data sources are needed THEN the system SHALL process and integrate complementary research data
5. WHEN research topics are searched THEN the system SHALL return processed and summarized results

### Requirement 6: Advanced Analytics and Trend Analysis

**User Story:** As a water management expert, I want sophisticated analysis of groundwater trends and projections, so that I can identify risks and plan appropriate interventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trend identification is requested THEN the system SHALL analyze improvement or deterioration patterns
2. WHEN comparative analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL compare data between different assessment periods
3. WHEN risk assessment is queried THEN the system SHALL evaluate risks for different groundwater categories
4. WHEN projections are requested THEN the system SHALL provide modeling based on historical data
5. WHEN correlation analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL analyze relationships between recharge and extraction

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As any system user, I want fast and reliable responses regardless of system load, so that I can efficiently access groundwater information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any data query is made THEN the system SHALL respond within 3 seconds
2. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL support 1000+ concurrent users
3. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the system SHALL use efficient caching strategies
4. WHEN large datasets are involved THEN the system SHALL implement progressive loading
5. WHEN accessed from mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design

### Requirement 8: Data Security and Compliance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want secure and compliant data handling, so that sensitive groundwater information is protected according to government policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement secure authentication
2. WHEN external APIs are accessed THEN the system SHALL apply rate limiting for SERP API calls
3. WHEN sensitive data is handled THEN the system SHALL implement data anonymization where required
4. WHEN government data is processed THEN the system SHALL comply with official data policies
5. WHEN system activities occur THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logging for queries and responses

### Requirement 9: System Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and analytics, so that I can track system performance, user satisfaction, and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN queries are processed THEN the system SHALL track query success rates
2. WHEN responses are generated THEN the system SHALL measure response accuracy
