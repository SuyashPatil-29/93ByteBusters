## Key Changes from Original Plan

### Major Additions:

1. **Phase 0 - UUID Discovery System**: Complete new phase dedicated to solving the core problem of finding location UUIDs
   - Automated scraping and mapping of INGRES location hierarchy
   - Intelligent location search and matching
   - Persistent UUID database with caching

2. **FireCrawl Integration**: Added throughout all data retrieval phases
   - Real-time data scraping from INGRES URLs
   - Dynamic URL generation using discovered UUIDs
   - Respectful crawling with rate limiting and caching

3. **Enhanced Location Intelligence**: 
   - Natural language location parsing
   - Fuzzy search for location variations
   - Automatic location type detection
   - Location hierarchy navigation

4. **UUID-Based Architecture**: All data operations now UUID-centric
   - UUID validation and verification
   - UUID-based caching strategies
   - Location-aware error handling

### Implementation Priority:

**Critical Path**: Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2.1 & 2.5 → Phase 3 → Others

**Why Phase 0 is Critical**: Without UUID discovery, none of the INGRES data retrieval will work. This must be implemented and tested first.

## Technical Implementation Details

### UUID Discovery Strategy

```typescript
// Primary approach: Scrape INGRES navigation structure
const discoveryFlow = {
  1: "Scrape main INGRES page for state navigation",
  2: "Extract state UUIDs and names from HTML/JavaScript", 
  3: "For each state, scrape district pages",
  4: "Extract district UUIDs with parent state relationships",
  5: "For critical districts, scrape block-level data",
  6: "Build comprehensive location mapping database",
  7: "Implement fuzzy search and matching algorithms"
};
```

### FireCrawl URL Generation Pattern

```typescript
// Dynamic URL generation for any location
const generateINGRESUrl = (locationUUIDs: LocationUUIDs, params: QueryParams) => {
  const baseUrl = 'https://ingres.iith.ac.in/gecdataonline/gis/INDIA';
  const urlParams = [
    `locname=${encodeURIComponent(params.locationName)}`,
    `loctype=${params.locationType}`,
    `view=ADMIN`,
    `locuuid=${locationUUIDs.locuuid}`,
    `year=${params.year}`,
    `computationType=${params.computationType || 'normal'}`,
    `component=${params.component}`,
    `period=${params.period}`,
    `category=${params.category}`,
    `stateuuid=${locationUUIDs.stateuuid}`
  ];
  
  return `${baseUrl};${urlParams.join(';')}`;
};
```

### Enhanced Tool Functions

```typescript
// Enhanced getGroundwaterStatus with UUID resolution
async function getGroundwaterStatus(
  locationQuery: string,
  year?: string,
  component?: string
) {
  // 1. Parse location from natural language
  const parsedLocation = await parseLocationQuery(locationQuery);
  
  // 2. Discover UUIDs for the location
  const locationUUIDs = await locationService.findLocationUUIDs(
    parsedLocation.name, 
    parsedLocation.type
  );
  
  if (!locationUUIDs) {
    return { error: "Location not found in INGRES system" };
  }
  
  // 3. Generate INGRES URL with UUIDs
  const url = generateINGRESUrl(locationUUIDs, {
    locationName: parsedLocation.name,
    locationType: parsedLocation.type,
    year: year || '2024-2025',
    component: component || 'recharge'
  });
  
  // 4. Scrape data using FireCrawl
  const scrapedData = await firecrawl.scrapeUrl({
    url,
    formats: ['html', 'markdown'],
    includeTags: ['table', 'div[class*="data"]', 'span[class*="value"]']
  });
  
  // 5. Extract and format groundwater data
  const groundwaterData = await extractGroundwaterData(scrapedData);
  
  return {
    location: parsedLocation,
    data: groundwaterData,
    source: url,
    lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
  };
}
```

### Location Query Processing Examples

```typescript
const locationQueryExamples = {
  "Show me groundwater status in Bangalore": {
    parsed: { name: "Bengaluru (Urban)", type: "DISTRICT" },
    uuids: { locuuid: "fc194628-dfa2-4026-b410-5535a5ceea8c", stateuuid: "eaec6bbb-a219-415f-bdba-991c42586352" }
  },
  
  "What's the water table in Karnataka": {
    parsed: { name: "Karnataka", type: "STATE" },
    uuids: { locuuid: "eaec6bbb-a219-415f-bdba-991c42586352", stateuuid: "eaec6bbb-a219-415f-bdba-991c42586352" }
  },
  
  "Compare groundwater between Mumbai and Delhi": {
    parsed: [
      { name: "Mumbai", type: "DISTRICT" },
      { name: "New Delhi", type: "DISTRICT" }
    ],
    requiresMultipleUuidLookups: true
  }
};
```

### Error Handling and Fallbacks

```typescript
const errorHandlingStrategy = {
  "UUID Not Found": [
    "Try alternative location name spellings",
    "Search in cached historical mappings", 
    "Attempt partial matches with user confirmation",
    "Fallback to manual UUID entry with validation"
  ],
  
  "Scraping Failed": [
    "Retry with exponential backoff",
    "Try alternative URL patterns",
    "Use cached data if available",
    "Inform user of data staleness"
  ],
  
  "Data Parsing Failed": [
    "Try alternative parsing strategies",
    "Extract partial data with warnings",
    "Provide raw data with apology",
    "Log for manual review and improvement"
  ]
};
```

### Performance Optimization

```typescript
const optimizationStrategies = {
  "UUID Caching": "KV/Prisma cache with 24h TTL for UUID mappings",
  "Data Caching": "6h TTL for scraped groundwater data",
  "Batch Processing": "Group multiple location queries in single scraping session",
  "Predictive Loading": "Pre-fetch data for commonly queried locations",
  "CDN Integration": "Cache static resources and common query results"
};
```

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Start with Phase 0.1**: Implement the basic UUID discovery system
2. **Validate with known locations**: Test the system works with Bengaluru and a few other known locations  
3. **Build incrementally**: Add one location type at a time (states → districts → blocks)
4. **Validate data quality**: Ensure scraped data matches expected INGRES format
5. **Scale gradually**: Expand to more locations as the system proves stable

This enhanced plan addresses the core challenge of UUID discovery while maintaining all the original requirements and adding significant new capabilities for dynamic data retrieval from the INGRES system.
